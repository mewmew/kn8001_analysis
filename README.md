See [code/quant_immuno_nuclei.py](code/quant_immuno_nuclei.py) for quantification of nuclei and immunostaining markers.

See [code/quant_immuno_neurite.py](code/quant_immuno_neurite.py) for quantification of neurite area.

## Data

See [data](https://osf.io/8gw5c/files/osfstorage) for CZI and TIFF immunostaining images used for quantification.
